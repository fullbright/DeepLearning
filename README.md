## 4 types of AI
 - think like a human (how does a humain think, reacts, feels)
 - acts like a human (turing test. A user A questions a user B and a machine C. A shouldn't be able to distinguish the machine C from the human B. )
 - think rationally (reasons logically)
 - acts rationnaly (doesn alwways reasons before acting rationnally. eg: remove your hand from the hot cup of tea)
 
## How does it work ?
 2 steps : 

 - step 1 : the training
 - step 2 : tests it against a set of know data to verify 
 
 Types : 
 - Classification : we tell it which classes we want
 - Clusturing : he guesses which classes to have and gather item by those classes
 - Regression : find the best parameters to output the best best responses 
 
 The algorithms
  - supervised
  - unsipervised
  
 The data to use
 
 *Very important to have a good quality of data*
 Types of data : 
  - classifyable
  - quantifiable
  - ...

 -> Machine Learning
    -> Deep learning
	
Deep learning is a branch of the machine learning.
Works with layers. 
Eg : picture of a cat.
  -> Layer 1 : pixels recog
  -> Layer 2 : forms recog
  -> Layer 3 : object recog
We train the layers separately and make sure that that layer output the correct value for the next input.

Is composed of neurons. The neuron has a fonction f(x) = (x1*w1)+(x2*w2)+(x3*w3).
Input a know data -> Output the correct value. If error correct the weights w.
Objective : have the correct weights w1, w2, w3.

What is the difference with the neronal network ? 
The use of the abstraction layer.

DeepLearing is more at the logical part : it thinks and acts rationaly.

Upload an image to the site and it will tell what is sees in the image.

[TODO] An idea is to check if we can recognize the logos in a pdf file to guess the company that sends the document.
May be deeplearning can handle that.
